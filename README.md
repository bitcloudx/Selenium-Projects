# Selenium-Projects

A simple Selenium bot that can scrape data from yahoo finace about stocks that I am personally interested in. This data is then uploaded to a google sheets using the google api and is then going to be used for ratio's and comparisons for my personal use. I will be sharing the whole project as I work on it. It will involve Python and flask on the backEnd and Javascript/CSS/HTML on the front. Should be fun, Stay tuned for updates!
